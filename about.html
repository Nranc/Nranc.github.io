		         	<h3>Graduation</h3>
		            <p> Hi everyone, my name is Nicolas Ranc. I'm a french student in a transition year between my fourth and fifth years at CPE Lyon (Chemistry, 
		            Physics & Electronics). 2 years of preparatory classes allowed be to integrate my school. It teached me rigour, scientific knowledge 
		            and I have discovered a passion for IT. Next year I'll be graduate as software developer. Inquisitive, I am constantly looking for new languages 
		            and new techniques to solve problems. Projects enabled me attitudes of deadlines, teamwork and responsibility.
		            </p>    
		            
		            <h3>Current internship</h3>
		            <p>This year, in accordance to my studies, I have decided to go one year abroad to improve my skills by a learning-by-doing process. 
		            I am currently working as an intern in Thales Hengelo in the Netherlands.
		            Thales is a company acting in a variety of security areas such as Defense, Security, Space etc. In Hengelo, study area is specialized on 
		            Radar Systems. I have 2 assignments in the INAETICS project : first task was about a MATLAB interface for Apache Avro Framework 
		            (Object-Oriented Programming C++), second task is the investigation of Docker Swarm CLI - and adapt this solution
		            to the INAETICS system (Previous orchestration system "Fleet" is deprecated).</p>
		           
		            <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>	      
		            <p>I like to travel, to discover new culture and new people.</p>      
		          	<p>I am an athlete. I do particularly running and fitness, tennis when i was younger. My running set up is available on Strava (Sports App). 
		          	Currently, I'm training for a Marathon. What drives me most is the passion I have for the sport. I am always pushing my limits.
